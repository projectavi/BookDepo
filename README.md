# Book Depo - Project Avi

This is the repository for the Book Depo project I was working on. It's a simple web-scraper which communicates through a Svelte JS frontend to an Express Node JS which runs a Python script. My other projects are viewable on projectavi.net

## Installation

The web version of this application (project-bookdepo.herokuapp.com) works, but it works a bit erratically with Heroku. To use this offline, Node JS and Python must be installed. After that, cd into the folder and run npm install.

Aside from that, in python-scripts/main.py, comment out Line 255, and uncomment Line 256. This is done by removing the # at the beginning of Line 256 and adding one at the beginning of Line 255.
